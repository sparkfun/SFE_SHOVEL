This is the Semi-Horned Oblong Versatile Eating Ladel, or as we like to call it, the S.H.O.V.E.L. This is not your run-of-the-mill
spork(foon), ladies and gentlemen! It also has a serrated knife, a bottle cap opener, and six feet of red paracord to wrap around its 
sturdy titanium body. Here's the best part: it's open-sourced. (No, we aren't joking.)

We want to show the world that OSHW is not just circuits and PCBs. The idea of open source can be applied to just about any product.
This S.H.O.V.E.L. is intended as more of a figurehead example of open-sourcing EVERYTHING. In the end, we hope that open-sourcing doesn't
stop with circuits, let alone a spork. The sky is the limit with OSHW. This you can design a better S.H.O.V.E.L.? Go for it! Download the files below and make
your own. "No patents pending."
